);
```

### API Functions
- `createShareableResult()` - Generate shareable link

- `getHostShareableResults()` - List host's shared results
- `getDemoShareableResult()` - Demo data for testing

### URL Structure
- **Public Results**: `/share/{unique-token}`
- **Demo Page**: `/share-demo`

## 🎉 Ready for Use

The feature is fully implemented and ready for use! The database schema needs to be applied, but the demo functionality works immediately without any setup.

### Next Steps:
