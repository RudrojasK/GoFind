   - Go to the Results page in your dashboard
   - Click "Create Shareable Link" on any completed game
   - Link is automatically copied to clipboard

2. **Manage Shared Results**:

   - Copy links again or view them directly
   - Share with participants, parents, or anyone interested

### For Viewers

1. **Access Results**: Click on a shared link or visit `/share/{token}`
2. **View Results**: See the complete game results with:
   - Game information (title, room code, date, duration)
   - Winners podium with top 3 players
   - Complete leaderboard with all participants
   - Player avatars and scores
3. **Share Further**: Copy the link to share with others

## Database Setup

Execute the SQL schema file to create the required database table:

```sql
-- Run the contents of database/shareable_results_schema.sql in your Supabase database
```

## API Endpoints

### Create Shareable Result
```typescript
import { createShareableResult } from '@/services/shareService'

const result = await createShareableResult(roomCode, hostId, {
  players: gameResults.players,
  duration: gameResults.duration,
  host_name: hostName
})
```

### Get Shareable Result (Public)
```typescript
import { getShareableResult } from '@/services/shareService'

const result = await getShareableResult(shareToken)
```

### Get Host's Shareable Results
```typescript
import { getHostShareableResults } from '@/services/shareService'

const results = await getHostShareableResults(hostId)
```

## URL Structure

- **Shareable Link**: `https://your-domain.com/share/{unique-token}`
- **Token Format**: Random alphanumeric string (30+ characters)
- **Example**: `https://gofind.ai/share/abc123def456ghi789jkl012`

## Security Features
